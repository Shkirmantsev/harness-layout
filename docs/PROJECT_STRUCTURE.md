# Project structure and ownership

[Documentation map](README.md) · [Project home](../README.md) · [Wiki index](../.ai/wiki/INDEX.md)

The harness has three connected paths:

```text
AGENTS.md -> relevant conventions + skill router -> task workflow
OpenSpec config -> production-sdd schema -> templates -> change artifacts
Wiki Markdown -> index command -> disposable SQLite -> MCP -> client retrieval
```

## Who owns each file family?

| Source | Purpose and consumer | Maintenance |
|---|---|---|
| [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) | Shared entry contract for agents | Small, stable instructions |
| [Conventions](conventions/README.md) | Design, implementation, testing, and review defaults selected by task | Authored guidance; not automatically executable checks |
| [Wiki](../.ai/wiki/INDEX.md) | Current explanatory knowledge consumed by humans and project-context MCP | Edit Markdown, then rebuild index |
| [OpenSpec config](../openspec/config.yaml) | Selects schema and artifact rules for OpenSpec | Authored configuration |
| [Production-SDD schema](../openspec/schemas/production-sdd/schema.yaml) | Declares template paths and artifact prerequisites | Consumed by OpenSpec CLI; harness checks structure |
| [Runtime policy](../.harness/runtime.json) | Read by skill router, session-state manager, and prompt manifest | Canonical JSON input, not generated cache |
| [ContextPack schema](../schemas/context-pack.schema.json) | Documents output shape of [context_pack.py](../scripts/context_pack.py) | Contract; not currently loaded as a JSON Schema validator |
| [Session schema](../schemas/session-state.schema.json) | Documents checkpoint shape; [session_state.py](../scripts/session_state.py) performs its own validation | Contract; distinguish schema from runtime implementation |
| [Current task](../.ai/state/CURRENT.md) | Short manual handoff for agents | Operational, not Wiki knowledge; not automatically synchronized with session JSON |
| [.env.example](../.env.example) | Supported settings merged by [bootstrap_env.py](../scripts/bootstrap_env.py) into private `.env` | Template, never real credentials |
| [Client generator](../scripts/configure_clients.py) | Produces ignored Claude/OpenCode/Codex config from `.env` | Edit generator/input, regenerate outputs |
| [Management CLI](../harness.py) | Initializes, indexes, installs MCP, and validates | [Makefile](../Makefile) provides convenience wrappers |

## Generated and optional areas

`tmp/local/project-context/` holds the SQLite index, state JSON, and MCP virtual
environment. `.generated/` holds client credentials and runtime outputs. Both are
ignored and must never become the canonical knowledge source.

The [MCP core](../tools/mcp/project-context-mcp/project_context_mcp/core.py) indexes
only `.ai/wiki/**/*.md`. Linking conventions from the Wiki makes them discoverable;
it does not copy their full text into the index. Follow the link when that guidance
is relevant. OpenSpec context is retrieved through the separate `spec_context` tool.

Empty Wiki `domain/`, `modules/`, `interfaces/`, and `adr/` directories are extension
points. Add pages when real work yields durable knowledge; empty folders are not
missing runtime dependencies. Likewise, `openspec/specs/` and `openspec/changes/`
start empty and must not be filled with invented requirements.

Optional [Compose services](../infra/compose.yaml) and the
[remote Hermes sidecar](../remote/hermes-worker-mcp/README.md) are outside the core
Wiki retrieval path. Health checks are separate from core tests.
